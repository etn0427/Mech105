# Function Definition
This functions used the simspons 1/3 rule to approximate the integral (I)
of a given set of x and y coordinates. It is able to use the 1/3 rule for
all but the last section of the coordinates by replacing it with a
trapazodial method if the number of spacings is odd
## Inputs:
    x = values of evenly spaced x coordinates in increaseing order
    y = y values of the related x values
## Outputs:
    I = approximate integral of the x and y coordinates
